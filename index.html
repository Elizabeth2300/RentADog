  <h1>RentaDog.co</h1>
  <h3>Mission statement:</h3>
  <p>To give every child or person the opportunity to “own” a dog. Making dreams come true since 2010.</p>

  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>Dogs are everyone’s friend. That is why Christina McRae invented RentADog. It gives everyone the joy of having a dog or puppy, but temporarily. There is a wide range of dogs breeds we have. If there is one that you specifically want we can source the breed in one of our many local pop-up stores. The dogs are all trained and ready to be played with. We only have kid friendly breeds to ensure safety in all our customers. We provide dogs/puppies for parties, barbecues, and other events. Please consider borrowing a canine from RentADog, a way to have a dog without the full commitment.</p>
